Installed Armadillo library to handle matrix multiplication using C++. Further documentation can be found at http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html. To compile, use "g++ example.cpp -o example -std=c++11 -O2 -larmadillo". The example code was just a simple matrix multiplication. The plan for next time is to try solve a random Ax=b linear equation.

Tried redoing the example given in the documentation for sparse matrix solve. Then, I tried including circuit_1 benchmark matrix from SuiteSparse Collection. In order to implement that, I have to read the .mtx file into variables inside the code. The sparse matrix, A has been successfully read with no error. The plan for next time is to try a read vector, b into the variable.
